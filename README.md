Wearable Gait Recognition using TinyML

Overview
This project implements a wearable gait recognition system using sensor data
and a lightweight machine learning model suitable for TinyML applications.

The system extracts statistical features from accelerometer signals and trains
a Decision Tree classifier for gait classification.
